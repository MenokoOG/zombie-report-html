# Zombie Report & Tracker

Demo: https://menokoog.github.io/zombie-report-html/

Welcome to the **Zombie Report & Tracker** project! This is an interactive web application designed to teach the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a creative twist â€” reporting zombie sightings to the CDC!

## Project Overview

This project provides an engaging platform for learning web development fundamentals by allowing users to report zombie sightings and track outbreak metrics. The project also uses Chart.js to display dynamic data on zombie growth over time.

## Features

- **Zombie Reporting Form**: Users can report a zombie sighting by filling in the location and description of the zombie.
- **Zombie Metrics Dashboard**: Track the total number of zombies, infection rates, and outbreak levels.
- **Dynamic Zombie Growth Chart**: The zombie outbreak is displayed graphically using Chart.js.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Save zombie reports locally in the browser and edit or delete reports as needed.
- **Random Data Generation**: Dynamically generates zombie growth, infection rates, and sighting locations.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling the pages, including layout and design features.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and managing local storage.
- **Chart.js**: Visualizing zombie growth data in real-time.
